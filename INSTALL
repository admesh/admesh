To install ADMesh, you will need a system with a c compiler.
Do the following:

1.  Get the file admesh-x.xx.tar.gz
2.  Extract the archive.  i.e. type something like the following:
         tar -zxvf admesh-x.xx.tar.gz
    The source files will be extracted into a directory called admesh-x.xx
3.  cd admesh-x.xx
4.  type the following:
         ./configure
	 make
	 su -c 'make install'

That should do it. Standard options for configure script and make are provided.
