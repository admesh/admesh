.SH NAME
ADMesh - a program for processing triangulated solid meshes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B admesh
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIfile\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
ADMesh is a program for processing triangulated solid meshes. Currently, ADMesh only reads the STL file format that is used for rapid prototyping applications, although it can write STL, VRML, OFF, and DXF files.

By default, ADMesh performs all of the mesh checking and repairing options
on the input file.  This means that is checks exact, nearby,
remove-unconnected, fill-holes, normal-directions, and normal-values.  The
file type (ASCII or binary) is automatically detected.  The input file is
not modified unless it is specified by the \fB--write\fP option.  If the following
command line was input:

.B admesh sphere.stl

The file sphere.stl would be opened and read, it would be checked and fixed
if necessary, and the results of processing would be printed out.  The
results would not be saved.

The default value for tolerance is the length of the shortest edge of the
mesh.  The default number of iterations is 2, and the default increment is
0.01% of the diameter of a sphere that encloses the entire mesh.

If any of the options \fB--exact\fP, \fB--nearby\fP, \fB--remove-unconnected\fP, \fB--fill-holes\fP,
\fB--normal-directions\fP, \fB--reverse-all\fP, \fB--normal-values\fP, or \fB--no-check\fP are
given, then no other checks besides that one will be done unless they are
specified or unless they are required by ADMesh before the specified check
can be done.  For example the following command line:

.B admesh --remove-unconnected sphere.stl

would first do an exact check because it is required, and then the
unconnected facets would be removed.  The results would be printed and no
other checks would be done.

.PP
The functions are executed in the same order as the options shown here.
So check here to find what happens if, for example, \fB\-\-translate\fR and \fB\-\-merge\fR
options are specified together.  The order of the options specified on the
command line is not important.
.SH EXAMPLES
To perform all checks except for nearby, the following command line would be
used:

.B admesh --exact --remove-unconnected --fill-holes --normal-directions --normal-values sphere.stl

Actually, since the \fBexact\fP check is required by ADMesh before
\fBremove-unconnected\fP, and \fBremove-unconnected\fP is required before \fB--fill-holes\fP,
the above command line could be shortened as follows with the same results:

.B admesh --fill-holes --normal-directions --normal-values sphere.stl

And again the same results could be achieved using the short options:

.B admesh -fudev sphere.stl

or

.B admesh -fdv sphere.stl
   
The following command lines do the same thing:

.B admesh sphere.stl

.B admesh -fundev sphere.stl

.B admesh -f -u -n -d -e -v sphere.stl

since the \fB-fundev\fP options are implied by default.  To eliminate one of the
checks, just remove the letter of the check to eliminate from the "word" fundev.
